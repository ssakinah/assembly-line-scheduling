# assembly-line-scheduling

This was an assignment project for Design & Analysis of Algorithms course

Objectives:
This assignment evaluates your understanding on algorithms, the concepts of analyzing
algorithms through empirical method (experiment) and at the same time expose students to
dynamic programming strategy in algorithm design.

Assignment coding specification:
1. Find an assembly line scheduling using dynamic programming source codes (Java
programming language) from Internet. Modify the codes to handle random generate
of input for different number of stations.

2. Add counters to count the primitive operations performed.
